				TODO THIS DOCUMENTATION IS INCOMPLETE

				Registers a callback for the log capture system. It will be called with a single Variant containing a dictionary containing "type" and "text" fields, and optionally including "function", "file", "line", and "rationale". Note that this callback can be called simultaneously from multiple threads, even while the Node script environment is running, so the implementation must be thread-safe.

				If the callback is registered before the first frame, it will immediately replay all messages from the start of the game, in order.

				There's currently no way to unregister the callback or register more than one callback. This should probably be fixed if it becomes part of the engine.
